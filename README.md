# PHP Routers Benchmark

## Introduction

This is a playground
where [FastRoute](https://github.com/nikic/FastRoute), [Symfony Router](https://github.com/symfony/routing),
and my own creation â€” [Pathfinder](https://github.com/norvica/pathfinder), which is built using a Trie data structure â€” 
go head-to-head in a performance showdown. This isn't so much about helping you pick a router as it is a curiosity project
â€” can a new contender outperform tried-and-true solutions? ðŸ™ƒ See the benchmarks below to find out.

## Getting Started

If you'd like to run benchmarks, ensure you've installed the required packages:

```bash
composer install
```

All benchmarks are set up using [PHPBench](https://github.com/phpbench/phpbench) library.

For all benchmarks, a set of [223 routes](./src/Generator/PseudoApi.php) that closely resemble real-life scenarios is used.

I ran this benchmark on my **MacBook Pro (15-inch, 2016)**.

## Cold Start

This scenario simulates the situation where the router and its routes are constructed without any cache (e.g., file
cache).

```bash
./vendor/bin/phpbench run src/BenchmarkCold --report=aggregate
```

## Warm Start

In this scenario, we consider the use of compiled routes cache stored in a file.

```bash
./vendor/bin/phpbench run src/BenchmarkWarm --report=aggregate
```

## Instantiated

Although it may not be a common use-case, this benchmark tests performance in long-running PHP processes. Note: Given
PHP's traditional request-response nature, using long-running processes could be debatable.

```bash
./vendor/bin/phpbench run src/BenchmarkInstantiated --report=aggregate
```
